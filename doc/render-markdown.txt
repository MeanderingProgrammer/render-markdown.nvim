6. Commands                                         *render-markdown-commands*

`:RenderMarkdownToggle` - Switch between enabling & disabling this plugin

- Function can also be accessed directly through `require('render-markdown').toggle()`


==============================================================================
7. Purpose                                           *render-markdown-purpose*

There are many existing markdown rendering plugins in the Neovim ecosystem.
However, most of these rely on syncing a separate browser window with the
buffer. This is the correct way to do things to get full feature support,
however I wanted something that worked completely inside of Neovim and made
things look slightly "nicer".

The closest one I found to this was headlines.nvim
<https://github.com/lukas-reineke/headlines.nvim>, which is an awesome plugin
that I took several ideas from. However it just didn’t have quite what I was
looking for. In particular I wanted something that would disappear completely
when editing a file and quickly render some style when viewing the file. Hence
this plugin.


==============================================================================
8. Markdown Ecosystem                     *render-markdown-markdown-ecosystem*

There are many `markdown` plugins that specialize in different aspects of
interacting with `markdown` files. This plugin specializes in rendering the
buffer inside of Neovim, for instance. As a result some plugins will clash with
this one, whereas other plugins handle orthogonal concerns and can be used in
addition to this one. Below is a categorized (incomplete) list of available
plugins.


RENDER IN NEOVIM         *render-markdown-markdown-ecosystem-render-in-neovim*

Using any of these plugins with this one will likely lead to undesired behavior
as different functionality will clash.

- headlines.nvim <https://github.com/lukas-reineke/headlines.nvim> - Same high
    level idea and starting point of this plugin, but with different feature sets


RENDER IN BROWSER       *render-markdown-markdown-ecosystem-render-in-browser*

These can be used as a second pass to get a real preview of the `markdown`
file. Since they do not interact with the buffer directly there should be no
issues.

- markdown-preview.nvim <https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim>
- vim-markdown-composer <https://github.com/euclio/vim-markdown-composer>


ORTHOGONAL                     *render-markdown-markdown-ecosystem-orthogonal*

These plugins handle functions completely separate from rendering and should
also have no issues running alongside this plugin.

- Any LSP which provides standard LSP capabilities, such as:
    - marksman <https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman> - General completion,
        definition, and reference functionality
    - markdown-oxide <https://github.com/Feel-ix-343/markdown-oxide> - Adds Obsidian
        PKM features to LSP
- markdown.nvim <https://github.com/tadmccorkle/markdown.nvim> - Adds `markdown`
    specific keybindings for interacting with `markdown` files
